## Overview
<b> CallbackLater </b> is an innovative mobile app designed to help users manage missed phone calls and WhatsApp voice/video calls, ensuring they never miss an important connection. The app automatically replies to missed calls 
with a custom message based on the user's status, such as when they are asleep, busy, or unavailable. Whether you’re working, sleeping, or in a meeting, CallbackLater makes sure the person calling knows why you couldn't 
answer and when you’ll be available to call back.

 ## Key Features
<b>Auto-Reply for Missed Calls:</b>
Automatically sends a customizable auto-reply message to anyone who calls you and you can’t answer.

<b>Users can set personalized messages for different situations, like:</b>
“I’m currently sleeping, I’ll call you back when I wake up.”
“I’m in a meeting, please leave a message and I’ll get back to you.”
“I’m unavailable at the moment, I’ll call you back as soon as I can.”

<b>Customizable Auto-Reply Messages:</b>
You can define multiple auto-reply templates for different situations.
The app also allows you to schedule the auto-reply feature for certain times of day (e.g., set it to automatically send your "sleeping" message between 10 PM and 7 AM).

<b>Automatic Detection of Missed Calls:</b>
The app automatically detects when a call is missed, whether it's from a regular phone call or a WhatsApp voice/video call.
No need to manually check missed calls or worry about forgetting to send a reply.

<b>Personalized Call Back Reminders:</b>
CallbackLater reminds you to return missed calls by creating a notification or a calendar reminder.
You can also set the app to schedule follow-up reminders to call back at the best time for you.

<b>Integration with Phone and WhatsApp:</b>
The app works seamlessly with both standard phone calls and WhatsApp calls, ensuring that you won’t miss any important communication from both traditional and messaging platforms.

## Easy Setup:

Setting up the auto-reply system is easy: just choose your status (e.g., "sleeping," "busy," "meeting"), write your message, and the app does the rest.
It can also be set to activate or deactivate automatically based on your phone's state (e.g., activated during "Do Not Disturb" mode).

Quick Responses for Your Contacts:
Custom auto-replies can be tailored for different contacts or contact groups. For example, you could set different auto-replies for family members versus work colleagues.

## Use Cases:

Busy Professionals: Stay professional by automatically sending your availability message while in meetings or focusing on tasks. CallbackLater ensures you won’t miss a call or leave someone waiting without a response.
Night Shifters/Heavy Sleepers: If you’re sleeping during the day, set up an automatic "sleeping" message to let callers know when you’re likely to be available.
Personal Time & Family: Automatically notify family and friends that you’re busy or unavailable without needing to explain it every time.
Important Communication: Whether it’s an emergency or an important follow-up, the app can remind you to return calls from specific contacts, ensuring you’re never caught off guard.

## Benefits:

Efficient Communication: Respond to missed calls even when you're not available, maintaining positive communication with others.
Customizable: Tailor the app to suit your needs, from work to personal time, with unique auto-replies and call-back reminders.
Hassle-Free Call Management: Let the app handle missed call responses and reminders, giving you more time to focus on other tasks.
